It's easy to see some [code contributions](https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile/)
on a GitHub repo, but what about everything else?

**Octohatrack** takes a github repo name, and returns two lists: 
    - A list of all users as defined by GitHub as a contributor
    - A list of all contributors to a project 

**What is a 'GitHub contributor'?**

On any GitHub repo page, the header at the top of the file listings shows a number of commits, branches, releases and contributors. If you [click the 'contributors' link](https://github.com/LABHR/octohatrack/graphs/contributors), you get a list of users that contributed code to the master branch of the repo, ordered by the commits and lines of code contributed. This list is limited to the top 100 users

**So, what are 'all contributors', then?**

That's everyone who's worked on a GitHub project. It compiles a complete list of the GitHub-defined contributors (not just the top 100), plus everyone who's created an issue, opened a pull requests, commented on an issue, replied to a pull request, made any in-line comments on code, edited the repo wiki, or in any other way interacted with the repo. 

**Limitations**

As at April 2016, there is no API endpoint for reactions, so these aren't able to be counted.

"Let's All Build a Hat Rack" ([\#LABHR](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23LABHR&src=typd)) is an
original concept by [Leslie Hawthorn](http://hawthornlandings.org/2015/02/13/a-place-to-hang-your-hat/)

## Debugging

### Cache

As of octohatrack 0.3.0, there is now a cache that gets created. 
Any time an external API call is made, it gets saved to a local
cache file so that any subsequent calls don't have to burn an API call.

You can disable the cache by using the `--no-cache` flag. 

To reset the cache, remove the `cache_file.json` file.

If you experience ongoing issues with the caching,
please [log a detailed issue describing what you're seeing](https://github.com/LABHR/octohatrack/issues/new)

### Wiki

Because GitHub doesn't have an API endpoint for being able to parse gollum-based repo-wikis, I've had to default to cloning repos locally and parsing via gitpython. 

If there are issues cloning the wiki, or other issues, it shouldn't break an octohatrack run, but if you do encounter issues, please [log an issue](https://github.com/LABHR/octohatrack/issues/new), and be sure to include platform information (this functionality has been tested on Mac OSX Yosemite and Ubuntu Xeniel)
