It's easy to see some [code contributions](https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile/)
on a GitHub repo, but what about everything else?

**Octohatrack** takes a GitHub repo name, and returns two lists: 

  - A list of all users as defined by GitHub as a contributor
  - A list of all contributors to a project 

**What is a 'direct contributor'?**

On any GitHub repo page, the header at the top of the file listings shows a number of commits, branches, releases and contributors. If you [click the 'contributors' link](https://github.com/LABHR/octohatrack/graphs/contributors), you get a list of users that contributed code to the master branch of the repo, ordered by the commits and lines of code contributed. This list is limited to the top 100 users.

GitHub also acknowledges 'Community Contributors', those that have contributed code to the master branch of repos that are dependencies of the current repo. The total count of these contributors is visible by hovering over the 'contributors' link on the main repo. 

*Update 2019-06-13 - GitHub now uses the term Direct and Communtiy contributor*

**So, what are 'all contributors', then?**

That's everyone who's worked on a GitHub project. It compiles a complete list of the GitHub-defined contributors (not just the top 100), plus everyone who's created an issue, opened a pull requests, commented on an issue, replied to a pull request, made any in-line comments on code, edited the repo wiki, or in any other way interacted with the repo. 

It also adds anyone manually added to the `CONTRIBUTORS` file on a repo (if it exists). See the bottom of [CONTRIBUTORS](https://github.com/LABHR/octohatrack/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS) for details on the formatting of this file. 

**Limitations**

* [GitHub Reactions](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments) are not counted. [Issue #87](https://github.com/LABHR/octohatrack/issues/87)
* Does not iterate over dependencies (although `octohatrack` could be run over these independently.)

"Let's All Build a Hat Rack" ([\#LABHR](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23LABHR&src=typd)) is an
original concept by [Leslie Hawthorn](http://hawthornlandings.org/2015/02/13/a-place-to-hang-your-hat/)

## Installation

```
pip install octohatrack
```

`octohatrack` requires Python 3. Check your `pip --version` to ensure that it's pointing to a Python 3 installation. If you have both Python 2.7 and Python 3 on your system, you may need to install using: 

```
pip3 install octohatrack
```

See "Debugging: Python 3 requirement" for more information.

## Usage

```
usage: octohatrack [-h] [--no-cache] [--wait-for-reset] [-v] username/repo

positional arguments:
  username/repo      the name of the repo to parse

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --no-cache         Disable local caching of API results
  --wait-for-reset  Enable waiting for rate limit reset rather than erroring
  -v, --version      show program's version number and exit
```

Define an environment variable for `GITHUB_TOKEN` to use an [authentication token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/) to avoide being [Rate Limited](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting)
to 60 requests per hour (allows for deeper searching).


## Run this repo locally

## Debugging

### Python 3 requirement

`octohatrack` requires Python 3.

This is because there's a number of features that require Python 3, and `octohatrack` is *not* `--universal`. More specifically, there are some system utils that are Python 3 only, and Unicode support in Python 3 is **so** much easier than in Python 2.

If you are having issues installing and are getting a `octohatrack requires a Python 3 environment` error, check: 
 - `python --version`
 - `pip --version`

If you are running in an environment with both Python 2 and Python 3, you may need to use `pip3` to install. 

There are two checks in `setup.py` and `__main__.py` that will end the installation or execution, respectively, running if it doesn't detect a Python 3 environment. 


If you *are* running in a Python 3 environment and it kicks you out, please [log an issue](https://github.com/LABHR/octohatrack/issues/new), including your `python --version`, and if you're running in a virtualenv. 

### Cache

In order to not make duplicate API calls, octohatrack uses caching via [`requests-cache`](https://github.com/reclosedev/requests-cache).  

Previous versions used a local `cache_file.json`. 

Any time an external API call is made, it gets saved to a local
cache file so that any subsequent calls don't have to burn an API call.

You can disable the cache by using the `--no-cache` flag. 

To reset the cache, remove the `cache_file.json` or `cache.sqlite` file.

If you experience ongoing issues with the caching,
please [log a detailed issue describing what you're seeing](https://github.com/LABHR/octohatrack/issues/new)

### Rate limiting

Even if you define a `GITHUB_TOKEN`, you may be rate limited for a popular repository. Using `--wait-for-reset` will have Octohatrack sleep until GitHub says your token is usable again.

### Wiki

Because GitHub doesn't have an API endpoint for being able to parse gollum-based repo-wikis, I've had to default to cloning repos locally and parsing via gitpython. 

If there are issues cloning the wiki, or other issues, it shouldn't break an octohatrack run, but if you do encounter issues, please [log an issue](https://github.com/LABHR/octohatrack/issues/new), and be sure to include platform information (this functionality has been tested on Mac OSX Yosemite and Ubuntu Xenial)
