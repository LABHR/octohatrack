It's easy to see your direct `code contributions`_ on GitHub, but what about everything else?

**Octohat** takes a github repo name, and returns a list of every github user that has interacted with a project, but has not committed code. 

Interactions include: 

* raising or commenting on an issue
* raising or commenting on a pull request
* commenting on a commit

"Let's All Build a Hat Rack" (`#LABHR`_) is an original concept by `Leslie Hawthorn`_

WARNING

on your system.
